The code used for the two miniprojects of UCLA's Digital Signal Processing Design Course. Both projects were created for use with the STM32Cube software using the NUCLEO-H743ZI2 board. Miniproject 1 uses a neural network to determine which out of four vowels was spoken into a microphone connected to pin A0. It can differentiate between "ah" as in father, "eh" as in bed, "ee" as in see, and "oo" as in food. Miniproject 2 unblurs handwritten numbers.
